# Safety Instructions

- The BMS shall only be used for the intended application.

- The maximum voltage and current of the connected batteries or loads must not exceed the limits of the BMS.

- Ensure that the BMS is configured correctly for the used battery type.

- Install the device considering general best practices for electrical and mechanical installations in accordance to laws in your country.

- An additional fuse must be installed as close to the battery positive terminal as possible.

- As sparks can occur during connection of the battery wires, don't install the BMS close to any flammable materials.

- The wire cross-section has to be large enough to handle at least the maximum specified current of the BMS.

- Use insulated tools only.

- Fix the wires outside the BMS to provide a strain relief and reduce forces on the terminals.

- Mount the device on a solid, non-inflammable material only. Depending on the ambient conditions and the average current, a heat sink may be required.
